<h1 class="Title">Pure Elements</h1>
<div>
<p>A team of elemental-themed Magical Girls, the Pure Elements serve as the protectors of S-City, fighting shapeshifting monsters called Disruptors that attack every night. They are overseen by a woman named Ms. Tanaka who has provided them with a training facility/base of operations/secret clubhouse.</p>
<p>Each of the Pure Elements controls a different classical element, and all of them are capable of using a technique called Luxury Mode to access a temporary boost in power. When two or more of the Pure Elements are present, they can perform a powerful combination attack called Ultimate Princess Explosion.</p>
<p>Prism Cherry, another Magical Girl, gets invited into the team as an honorary member after she befriends Princess Deluge.</p>

<h3>Secret Files</h3>
</div>
<div class="Spoiler-body">
<p>The Pure Elements are artificial Magical Girls created as part of an experiment to empower people who don't have the normal magical qualifications to become Magical Girls. They require regular intake of a special medicine in order to assume their Magical Girl forms and there is a time limit to using their powers, weaknesses that are not present in regular Magical Girls. The Disruptors are merely training homunculi that pose no actual threat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Princess Project&quot; was created by Pfle, now head of the Magical Kingdom's Research &amp; Development Department, as part of her plan to reshape the Magical Kingdom to her own desires. Ms. Tanaka is the original Lapis Lazuline, now known as Old Blue, who helped manipulate Pfle into creating the project for her own ends.</p>
<p>When word gets out about the artificial Magical Girls, various factions within the Magical Kingdom send agents or freelancers after the Pure Elements in order to capture or kill them. The Osk Faction, who has been experimenting with their own artificial Magical Girls, the Shufflin, in particular aim to destroy the Pure Elements while testing Shufflin's capabilities.</p>

<li>Magic: Can transform the reflections in her mirror.</li>

<p>An extremely average Magical Girl with not much in the way of gimmicks or skill, she’s greatly disappointed by her powers because she’s also quite average in her civilian life.

<p>Her magic can change the images in any reflective surface, though this does not affect the actual object or person that is being reflected. She can’t come up with any clever ways to use this power, so she considers it quite useless.</p>

<p>She appears to be killed early on in the Shufflin’s invasion, but she is actually secretly saved by Pythie Frederica, who teaches her an effective way to use her magic.

This unfortunately makes her a target, and she is killed by a spade Shufflin.</p>
