               <h2>Marika Fukuroi</h2>

                    <li>Real Name: Mariko Fukuroi</li>
                    <li>Magic: Can make various magic flowers bloom from her head.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>A plant-themed Magical Girl, Marika Fukuroi is a cheerful, irreverent Magical Girl who lives for battle, being so violent that she was actually kicked out of the Archfiend Cram School for being too aggressive. Though she greatly admires those stronger than her, she does not disrespect those who are weaker than her, and she is willing to use her power to aid others in any way she can. She is also far smarter than she comes across, being a high school science teacher in her civilian life.</p>
               <p>Marika’s magic allows her to grow flowers from her head that have different effects, depending on the type of flower. For example, she can create a sunflower that fires solar-powered lasers, or a cosmos with bladed petals. High versatile and dangerous, she is minorly held back by the fact that her flowers take time to grow, so she can’t swap powers on the fly, and she needs sunlight to make most plants grow.</p>

                         <p>Despite being the strongest Magical Girl in the conflict against Grim Heart, Marika is weakened by being in the Pure Elements’ underground headquarters, leaving her without adequate access to sunlight. Once Prism Cherry learns to use her magic to reflect sunlight, Marika turns the tide of battle and gives Snow White a chance to escape. However, Marika loses her friend Styler Mimi, leaving her feeling remorseful.</p>

               </ul>
               <p>A fashionista Magical Girl, Styler Mimi is old friends with Marika Fukuroi and often partners up with her on assignments. Mimi always complains about working with Marika, but she still goes along with Marika, mostly because her more level-headed and strategic personality keeps Marika from causing even more trouble than she usually does.</p>
               <p>Mimi’s magic allows her to change the appearance of anyone or anything in almost any way she wishes. The more different something is from its initial appearance, the longer it takes for her magic to work. Because Magical Girl outfits cannot be changed normally, Mimi runs a very successful beauty salon for Magical Girls who are not satisfied with their costumes, although Mimi’s magic is undone if they end their transformations. In combat, Mimi can use her magic to create camouflage to ambush others.</p>

               <p>A Magical Girl in a crocheted outfit, Filru used to work as a jailer, until she was fired over Pythie Frederica’s breakout in “Magical Girl Raising Project: Limited”. With a deep desire to keep busy and feel needed, Filru turned to freelance work in the hope of restoring her reputation and earning a new full-time position elsewhere in the Magical Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Filru’s magic needle and thread can pass through anything without damaging it, allowing her to trap enemies by sewing them to surfaces. She can also use her threads to sew wounds close and create near-invisible tripwires for catching enemies or sounding alarms.</p>

               <p>A Magical Girl in an outfit decorated with bubbles, she maintains a very casual demeanour and keeps smiling even in dangerous situations. As a freelancer, she is quick to get along with new people, claiming that it’s because she’s good at going with the flow.</p>
               <p>Uttakatta’s magic lets her create bubbles whose properties she can manipulate. By increasing their strength, they become strong enough to withstand an attack from a Magical Girl. They can be used to carry objects or individuals, depending on the bubbles’ size, and she can move them mentally.</p>

               <p>A Magical Girl in mourning clothes, Kafuria belongs to a club of Magical Girls with “useless” powers who meet regularly to discuss their hardships getting work as freelancers due to their powers. Although negative about her magic, Kafuria aims to do her best as a Magical Girl and prevent as many deaths as possible.</p>
               <p>Kafuria’s magic lets her see a skull mark on the forehead of whoever in the immediate area will die next. All she knows is that the person will die, but not when or by what means. If more than one person will die at the same time, all of them will have the skull mark. Any action can change a person’s fate to die next, so Kafuria is rarely able to get much use out of this power.</p>

               <p>A jester Magical Girl, Stanczyka doesn’t speak and only interacts with others through broad, acrobatic gestures. She appears to be gathering together the individual Magical Girls investigating S-City, who had previously been told by their sponsors and superiors not to interact with each other. She has particular interest in Snow White.</p>
               <p>Stanczyka’s magic allows her to perform daring acrobatic feats and summon related objects out of nowhere, such as balls to balance on.</p>
