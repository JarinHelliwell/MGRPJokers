               <h2>Snow White</h2>
               <ul>
                    <li>Real Name: Koyuki Himekawa</li>
                    <li>Magic: Can hear the thoughts of those in need.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>A Magical Girl in a white school uniform, Snow White was one of only two survivors of Musician of the Forest, Cranberry’s final exam. Having lost many friends during that exam, Snow White joined the Magical Kingdom’s Inspection Department and began a quest to punish Magical Girls who use their powers for selfish purposes. Now known as the Magical Girl Hunter, Snow White has become something of a legend in the Magical Kingdom, with few people realizing that she’s still just a scared young girl trying to do some good in the world.</p>
               <p>Her magic allows her to hear the surface thoughts of people who are in any sort of distress. The source of distress can include Snow White herself. Because her status as the Magical Girl Hunter often makes people uneasy around her, it is very easy for her to find people who are committing crimes. When she engages other Magical Girls in battle, she can read her opponent’s thoughts to gain a quick advantage, making up for her lack of skill.</p>

                         <p>Working together with the other surviving Magical Girls, Snow White manages to escape the Pure Elements’ facility and sends for help, forcing Grim Heart and Shufflin to retreat. However, she is not able to save her childhood friend, who became Princess Inferno, so she takes Inferno’s scimitar as a memento.</p>

               <p>A vampire Magical Girl, Lady Proud is a veteran Magical Girl who holds a position of leadership in the Department of Diplomacy, although by her own admission she’s not really much of a leader. With the recent death of Archfiend Pam, Lady Proud has been struggling to keep the rowdier members of the Department under control. She is somewhat happy that Pam died, because she would never have been able to surpass Pam otherwise, although she is secretly ashamed of feeling so callous about someone else’s death.</p>
               <p>Lady Proud can turn her blood into different liquids, although she can only change fresh blood in this way. Due to the hazardous nature of her power, she prefers to rely on her physical strength and speed, only using her powers when necessary.</p>

She turns her blood into an explosive to take all of the Disruptors out with her, and the incident causes the Pure Elements to realize that they’d been lied to.</p>

               <p>A Magical Girl in a rain coat, Umbrain is Lady Proud’s dedicated and trusted assistant despite being an elementary schooler in her human identity. True to her young age, she tends to be easily distracted and grows bored with tasks that Lady Proud gives her.</p>
               <p>Anything that touches Umbrain’s magic umbrella will do so softly, regardless of how heavy it is or how fast it was travelling. This effect works with any part of the umbrella and it doesn’t even have to be open. Umbrain can also use it like a parachute.</p>

               <p>A Magical Girl based on the Queen of Hearts from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Grim Heart is head of the Information Bureau. All she ever says is “Off with your head!”, and she is very nasty to her subordinate Shufflin.</p>
               <p>Grim Heart’s magic allows her to ignore anyone that she has decided is improper. Those she has ignored cannot touch her or affect her with any kind of magic. They can only hear her say “Off with your head!”, and she only hears them as speaking gibberish. Because of her haughty attitude and queenly demeanour, she deems virtually everyone to be improper.</p>

                         <p>Shufflin is not one individual, but rather 53 artificial Magical Girls created by the Osk Faction. Individual Shufflins represent the individual cards in a deck, with their strength based on their card’s value and their specialty based on their card’s suit. Spades are the combatants, Clubs are stealthy, Diamonds can use technology, and Hearts are the most durable. The Joker Shufflin serves as the head of their hive mind, controlling the other Shufflin remotely. If any Shufflin die, the Joker can sacrifice another Magical Girl in order to dispel all of the current Shufflin and replace them with a fresh deck.</p>
